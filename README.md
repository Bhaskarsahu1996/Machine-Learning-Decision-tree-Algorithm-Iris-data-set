# Machine-Learning-Decision-tree-Algorithm-Iris-data-set
This Project consist of Building a Machine Learning Model on Iris Data set by using Decision Tree Algorithms. Iris Data set is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.
One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are Id, SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm, Species.
